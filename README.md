# Breeze UI

Build your project with breeze using our shadcn based component library.

## Introduction

This project is a collection of reusable UI components built with Shadcn UI. Our goal is to provide a set of customizable and easy-to-use components that can be used to speed up your development process.

## Features

- Shadcn-based: Our components are built using Shadcn UI, making it easy to customize and extend them to fit your project's needs.
- Typescript: Every component is written in typescript. The types are defined on the component itself and can be re-writen to fit your needs.
- Customizable: Each component is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to change colors, spacing, and more to fit your brand.
- Easy to use: Our components are designed to be easy to use, with simple and intuitive APIs.

## Getting Started

Pick one component, copy and run the command. That's it!

## Customization

Our components are designed to be highly customizable. You can customize them using Tailwind's utility classes or by overriding the default styles.
